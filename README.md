Algorithms
==========

This is an attempt to build a cohesive module of algorithms in Python.

The purpose of this repo is to be a learning tool for myself and others.

I used psuedo code from various sources and I have listed them as references in the source code of each algorithm.

Algorithms implemented so far:
------------------------------

**Data Structures:**


**Sorting:**

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

**Searching:**


**Shuffling:**


**Math:**


Installation:
-------------

If you want to use the algorithms directly, simply

::

    $ pip install algorithms

If you want to examine the algorithms source, then you should clone this repo.

Usage:
------

Once installed you can simply do the following in your program:

::

    # create code sample


All prequisites for the algorithms are listed in the source code for each algorithm.


Tests:
------

Nose is used as the main test runner and all Unit Tests can be run by:

::

    $ python algo/run_tests.py
